# weather-app

## Project Description

This weather app uses the WeatherAPI to provide users with a three day & hourly forecast for any area within the U.S., U.K., and Canada. The app implements a search bar which requires users to enter in either a zipcode or city to get that area's weather forecast. Users can also switch between viewing the forecast in imperial units or metric units. Suitable for both desktop and mobile devices, the information provided is easy to view and understand.

In this project, I experimented with the Promise object, and used the methods within it to collect and use the data from the WeatherAPI. I also used async/await to become familiar with the different ways that promises can be implemented.
